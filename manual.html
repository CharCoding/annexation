		<h3 id="gd">Game Description</h3>
		This game is a world simulation game where each player acts as a nation and tries to eliminate all other nations. It requires a considerable amount of logical thinking and planning, the ability to convince people and to make loyal, dependable alliances, risk-taking and clever game strategies developed through experience. You start up somewhere in the world and work your way to become a superpower by constructing cities and colonies, expanding your territory, building a strong army and fighting in wars, and eventually being able to conquer other nations and win the game.<br />
		All players take turns to make moves on the map. Due to the complexity and sophistication of this game, each player's turn may take up to 15 minutes. During others' turns, you are recommended to plan ahead your moves and communicate with other players in order to benefit yourself.<br />
		This game is originally created by Raptor Wombat Gaming Studios. RWGS created the game and revamped the game mechanics multiple times in attempt to balance, simplify and realize the game. The current version (v6.0) is the first version RWGS collaborated with CharCoding Co. ltd to make a computer-based version of the game that does not rely on a game engine.
		<h3 id="mr">Master Rules</h3>
		These rules take precedence over all other rules in the game.
		<ol>
			<li>Cheating is not allowed. This includes hacking and generating illegal action commands.</li>
			<li>Friendship shouldn't be a major factor ingame (Although making and breaking alliances is allowed). Make actions that are the most beneficial to you, not your friend outside the game.</li>
			<li>"Ragequit" is not allowed. Play until your nation is completely eliminated.</li>
			<li>No "agreements" are to be followed strictly. Agreements between players can be broken freely at one's will. This includes whether to return loans.</li>
			<li>If a problem/conflict arises and no current rules present a solution, a new rule may be made up and kept for the game after everyone has agreed upon it.</li>
			<li>Try your best and/or have fun!</li>
		</ol>
		<h3 id="gs">Game Start</h3>
		When the game starts, every player is given a certain, fixed amount of cities, colonies and money. Players simultaneously choose a continent on the map to start up in and place their capitals in a certain tile. Changes can be made at this stage in order to compromise for disagreements between players. Once everyone is okay with their capital position, the players will be arranged in random order. Each player then take turn to place down the cities and colonies and make purchases on military units which are placed in any tile in the player's territory. When everyone has completed their setup, an initialization code is generated for everyone. The players then chooses their name to begin. The order they were randomly arranged in will be the turn order.
		<h3 id="wc">Winning Criteria</h3>
		Be the one and only nation left. A nation is considered dead/eliminated if either or both of the following is true:
		<ul>
			<li>The nation has no colonies left.</li>
			<li>The nation's capital is captured, and there are no adjacent tiles or ships to move the capital onto.</li>
		</ul>
		If a nation is dead, all its units are removed from the game. If another nation directly caused the nation's death, that nation receives 1 money.
		<h3 id="to">Turn order</h3>
		In your turn, events shall occur in the following order.
		<ol>
			<li>Lose any city if you have to.</li>
			<li>Collect income.</li>
			<li>Move your capital if necessary.</li>
			<li>Buy any city / colony / unit or trade with other players.</li>
			<li>Perform any military action and/or battle.</li>
			<li>Buy any city / colony / unit or trade with other players.</li>
			<li>Lose any city if you have to.</li>
		</ol>
		You may not skip your turn.
		<h3 id="es">Economy System</h3>
		The economy is based on cities and colonies. Each tile can only contain either colonies or cities. A new city or colony may be placed in tiles already containing other cities/colonies or an empty tile with your military units in them. There is no limit to the amount of cities in one tile, but each tile can only hold up to 6 colonies.
		You have to have the same amount or more colonies than cities. Otherwise, on the beginning or end of your turn you have to lose cities to make the two equal.<br />
		Each city cost 6 to establish, while the first colony in a tile costs 6. The second one costs 7, the next costs 8, and so on.<br />
		When you collect income on each turn, you receive twice the amount of cities you have at that moment. The amount of cities you have is the upper limit for your economic spending in that turn, while your military spending is unlimited.<br />
		If you end your turn and still have remaining money, you may keep them for the next round, but these money cannot be added to your economic spending limit.<br />
		If your capital was forced to move into a tile with no cities, your income is 0 but your economic spending is still the amount of cities you have.<br />
		You may trade with another player or loan money to others during or outside your turn. Anything can be traded, including money, military units, colonies and cities. A trade may span over multiple turns or rounds, and any part may terminate the trade at any time. A player may also threaten another and ask for a ransom.
